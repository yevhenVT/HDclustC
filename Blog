Copied from Hmmvb_package_v1.3 and revised based on that.

Designed specifically for Diagonal Gaussian covariance. Anticipate
very high dimensions. Hence sigma_det field in GaussModel is changed
to sigma_det_log. Only use the log of the determinant. A series of
functions are changed, including file IO.

---- Aug 29, 2017 ----
The previous #define DIAGCOV is now changed to a global constant.
The declaration is made in hmm.h.

The definition of DIAGCOV is in estimate.c which is visible to both
trainmaster.c and testsync.c.

trainmaster.c, testsync.c, ridgeline_md all have an option of
specifying whether diagonal covariance is used. "-v" flag means
diagonal covariance. If not flagged, non-diagonal is the default.
